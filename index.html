              We are beholden to a few Big Tech overlords for much of our
              digital lives. We can be more conscientious about it.

            For all of those activities, you probably used a product made or
            sold by Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook. There’s no simple way to
            avoid those Big Four. Even if you subscribed to Spotify, you would
            probably still be using a Google Android phone, an Amazon speaker or
            an Apple iPhone to stream the music. Even if you deleted Facebook,
            you might still be using the Facebook-owned Instagram or WhatsApp.

          <p text align="justify">
            Being beholden to a small set of companies that touch every corner
            of our digital lives is precisely why lawmakers have summoned the
            chief executives of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple to testify in
            an antitrust hearing on Wednesday. Expect the tech titans to be
            grilled over whether their companies have become so powerful and
            far-reaching that they harm rivals and all of us, too.

              <strong>Step 1 : When possible, find alternatives</strong><br />
              While Google Chrome may be the most popular web browser, there are
              alternatives that collect less data about us. And while all of our
              friends are on Facebook, there are also smaller apps or methods we
              can use to stay connected with them. The key is to read news sites
              and tech blogs to learn about options.

              <br /><strong>Step 2 : Why buy new? Buy used</strong><br />
              Speaking of alternatives, there’s a different way to buy tech
              hardware altogether: Purchase gadgets used or refurbished. When
              you buy a new phone or computer, your dollars go directly to the
              tech giants who created the products. But when you buy used, you
              are supporting a broader community of small businesses that repair
              and resell equipment.

              <br /><strong>Step 3 : Support indie developers</strong><br />
              A lot of what we do with our devices is made possible by smaller
              companies that produce our apps and games. One way to show our
              support to David rather than Goliath is to have some patience and
              empathy for the indie developers.

              When Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, promised in 2013 that
              drones would soon be flying everywhere delivering packages, a
              miniature camera whirring through homes and recording video was
              probably not what people envisioned.
            </p>

            <p text align="justify">
              But on Thursday, Amazon’s Ring division unveiled the $249 Ring
              Always Home Cam, a small drone that hums as it flies around houses
              filming everything, ostensibly for security purposes.

              Dave Limp, the executive responsible for Amazon’s devices, said it
              had made major investments in camera security, such as two-factor
              authentication and end-to-end encryption, that will roll out this
              year. “If Walt doesn’t want to buy this drone, then fine,” he
              said.

              <br />Ring said the drone would become available next year, but
              not “until authorization is obtained.” <br />Mr. Limp said he

              It depends on whom you ask. President Trump has said it is and has
              threatened to ban the app in the United States. But security
              experts are more hesitant to draw conclusions. While there is no
              direct evidence that TikTok has done anything malicious with
              people’s data, sharing information could be fundamentally less
              safe with a company that might allow the Chinese authorities to
              intercept it.
            </p>

            <p text align="justify">
              So I asked two companies that offer mobile security products to
              take a close look at TikTok’s app to see what they could glean
              about it. They had very different takes.
            </p>

            <p text align="justify">
              Disconnect, a San Francisco security firm, analyzed the code of
              the TikTok app for iOS. In July, the app’s code contained
              references to servers in China. Last weekend, Disconnect reviewed
              the app’s latest version and saw that the lines of code referring
              to Chinese servers had been removed.
